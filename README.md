### Hey, welcome to my GitHub's page!

- ðŸ’¼ I'm working for BRQ as a Senior Support Analyst, at Itau's project helping to make applications more secure. I'm at the security area where I deal with a lot of different things, like programming with Python, JavaScript, Java and Go, also I need to analyze incidents opened through Service Now and identify what was the problem that the user has faced, so in this process I have to analyze through many of our tools, that are Fortify, SD Elements, Bag of Holding, AWS Code Build, Jenkins and Pipepper.

- ðŸ“’ I'm currently learning Django, TypeScript and Next.js.

- ðŸ“Œ My next steps is learning all about AWS and more about DEVOPS.

- âš½ One of my main hobbies is playing video games with my friends online, mostly Fortnite and Rocket League, but also many other different games just to have fun and laugh. Also I have to say that programming is also a hobby of mine, I love spending my time programming, learning new things about it and even watch videos about it to entertain me.

> I'm working in a lot of things recently, I always have a lot of projects that I start, I'm intending to finish one important project and it will be for sure here after I finish it.
